//! # Workers
//! 
//! **Note: Workers are a work in progress and are not yet fully implemented.**
//! 
//! A worker is the base unit for work such as dispatching events to Luau VM's in AntiRaid
//! 
//! There is currently one layer in a worker construct:
//! 
//! - WorkerVMManager: Stores the Luau VM's per guild/user and handles the creation and retrieval of VMs within a worker
